# Data mining with time series
I originally made this repo. to deal with a cooperative education program I participated in during my study. This Python library contains .py files to perform signal processing, constructing machine learning algorithms, and plotting signal spectra. These files helped me a lot, and hopefully, they may be found useful in your projects as well.

In this repo., one data and a folder serve as an example of how to use the .py contained. For a better understanding, I am gonna make an imaginary scenario in which these example files originate.
## Imaging a machining process that can be monitored by working conditions such as vibrations, temperature, or any other signals. The goal is to predict the resultant quality of the process w/ the captured signals
